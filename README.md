AI Image Generator (DALL-E Clone)

This project is a web application that serves as a clone of OpenAI's DALL-E image generator. It utilizes React and various web technologies for the frontend, allowing users to input prompts and generate images based on those prompts.

Features
Prompt-based Image Generation: Users can input prompts describing what they want to see in an image, and the application generates corresponding images.

Real-time Feedback: Users receive real-time feedback as they type their prompts, with images updating dynamically as the input changes.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.

Technologies Used
React: Used for building the user interface and managing state.

Fetch API: Used to communicate with the OpenAI API for image generation.

HTML & CSS: Basic web technologies used for structuring and styling the application.
